#  House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

##  Objective
To develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict house prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, location, and more.

---

##  Overview
This project uses historical housing data to train a predictive model that estimates the price of a house. It applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization techniques to build a reliable regression model.
